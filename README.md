# Scaffold-ETH Challenge 1 : Decentralized Staking App
## Goal
This is a very fun challenge part of the project [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/master) 😄

The goal of this project is to build a decentralized fund-raising platform with a limited time to raise the funds. After this time, if the fund-raising is not successful, users can withdraw their funds invested in the project.

## How ?
We're given a front-end and a ready to build framework and we need to build the contract in solidity. 🧙‍♂️

To see my work you can look in [packages/hardhat/contracts/Staker.sol](https://github.com/MatteoMer/scaffold-eth-challenge1-staking/blob/challenge-1-decentralized-staking/packages/hardhat/contracts/Staker.sol)
